# Data and Systems

We primarily work with Administrative Medicaid Data which are stored across three separate systems depending upon the dataset and research project

#### De-identified Individual-Level State Medicaid Data
We have historic extracts of administrative claims data, eligibility, and enrollment data from several states. Most of this data is old, with the Connecticut data being the most recent and the only data set we are actively refreshing. These data are stored at Yale on our window-based server.

#### National De-identified Individual Level State Medicaid Data
We have recent extracts of National Medicaid data provided by CMS (T-MSIS TAF). This dataset begins in 2016 and there is a 2-3 year lag before the files are released in their final version. Due to the size of the data they are stored on the Milgram High Performance Computing (HPC) system at Yale, which is managed by the Yale Center for Research Computing (YCRC).

#### Individual-Level Connecticut Medicaid Data
Through a contract with the state of Connecticut, members of our team can obtained embedded access to Department of Social Services (DSS) systems to complete mutually agreed upon projects. After obtaining credentials, these data are accessed through an Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) and all analyses and data remain entirely within DSS systems. Data include identifiable individual-level Administrative Medicaid claims data, enrollment, eligibility and various other program-specific data sets (e.g., Long Term Services and Supports Assessment Data).
