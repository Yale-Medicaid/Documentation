Welcome to the Yale Medicaid Lab! We're excited to have you on the team and look forward to working with you on the problems that matter most to the Medicaid program. This page provides all the resources you need to get up and running on our projects, understand our workflow, and learn about how we build and deploy software!

## Administrative steps to getting started
There are several administrative steps to getting started that you may complete before you start:

1. Get your Yale NET ID and e-mail set up.
    - Send an e-mail to Anthony and Sam with your netID and Yale e-mail address. We will use this to give you access to data and invite you to all of the relevant workspaces.

    - Check with Sam to schedule an appointment with Dan Holland to set up your laptop and to get access to our server. You will need access to the following groups: 
        - Yale\ysph-hpm-rdpusers  (for RDP access)
        - Yale\ysph-hpm-ndumele (for access to Chimaâ€™s share)
    - When setting up your managed computer, requuest that ITS install the following programs:
        - Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
        - Microsoft Remote Desktop
        - Slack 
        - Dropbox
        - Asana
        - Zoom 
    - If these are not installed on your computer, or if there are other programs you need, e-mail Dan Holland and we can get ITS to install them on your computer. 

2. Complete all certifications and/or trainings required by the HR department. To determine what trainings you need to complete navigate [here](https://bmsweb.med.yale.edu/tms/tmspage).
    - You need to complete:
        - Human Subject Protection Training 
        - HIPAA Privacy and Security for Researchers 
        - Yale University HIPAA Security Attestation

3. Complete any I9 verifications or related workday HR administrative tasks that are required within your first week. 

4. Create various accounts that allow us to work collaboratively and remotely. For certain things, if you already have an account linked to your personal e-mail feel free to use that, or create another one using your Yale e-mail address.

## Getting to know the team and projects
