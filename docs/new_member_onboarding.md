## New Member Onboarding
Welcome to the Yale Medicaid Lab! We're excited to have you on the team and look forward to working with you on the problems that matter most to the Medicaid program. This page provides all the resources you need to get up and running on our projects, understand our workflow, and learn about how we build and deploy software!

## Administrative steps to getting started
There are several administrative steps to getting started that you may complete before you start:

1. Get your Yale NET ID and e-mail set up.
    - Send an e-mail to Anthony, Chima and Jacob with your netID and Yale e-mail address. We will use this to give you access to data and invite you to all of the relevant workspaces

    - If you will be accessing data on the Yale Center for Analytic Sciences (YCAS) server Anthony/Chima will need to request access to the following groups. 
        - Yale\ysph-hpm-rdpusers  (for RDP access)
        - Yale\ysph-hpm-ndumele (for access to Chimaâ€™s share)
    - When setting up your managed computer, Anthony/Chima will requuest that ITS install the following programs:
        - Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
        - Microsoft Remote Desktop
        - Slack 
        - Dropbox
        - Asana
        - Zoom 
    - If these are not installed on your computer, or if there are other programs you need, e-mail Dan Holland and we can get ITS to install them on your computer. 

2. Complete all certifications and/or trainings required by the HR department. To determine what trainings you need to complete navigate [here](https://bmsweb.med.yale.edu/tms/tmspage).
    - You need to complete:
        - Human Subject Protection Training 
        - HIPAA Privacy and Security for Researchers 
        - Yale University HIPAA Security Attestation

3. Create various accounts that allow us to work collaboratively and remotely. For certain things, if you already have an account linked to your personal e-mail feel free to use that, or create another one using your Yale e-mail address.

## Getting to know the team and projects
1. If you aren't familiar with the basics of the Medicaid program review [this](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/fact-sheet/medicaid-pocket-primer/) and ask Chima/Jacob/Anthony for additional resources if you would like more to read.

2. Meet with Jacob and Chima to discuss the projects you'll be working on, why they're important, and what your role will be.

3. Meet with Anthony to get an overview of the data science and engineering work that has been done by the Yale Medicaid Lab to date and where your work fits in.
