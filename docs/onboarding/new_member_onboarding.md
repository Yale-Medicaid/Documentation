# Welcome

Welcome to the SCALE (State Collaborations to Advance LEarning) in Medicaid Lab! We're excited to have you on the team and look forward to working with you on the problems that matter most to the Medicaid program. This page provides all the resources you need to get up and running on our projects, understand our workflow, and learn about how we build and deploy software!

## Administrative Steps
There are several administrative steps to getting started that you may complete before you start:

1. Get your Yale netID and e-mail set up.
    - Send an e-mail to Anthony with your netID and Yale e-mail address. We will use this to give you access to data and invite you to all of the relevant workspaces.
    - Check with Anthony to schedule an appointment with Dan Holland to set up your laptop and to get access to our server. You will need Chima to approve access to Dan Holland for the following groups: 
        - Yale\ysph-hpm-rdpusers (for RDP access)
        - Yale\ysph-hpm-ndumele (for access to Chimaâ€™s share)
        - storage@yale group: YSPH_HPM-CC0940-MEDSPH2 (where HIPAA Medicaid data is stored)
    - When setting up your managed computer, request that ITS install the following programs:
        - Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
        - Microsoft Remote Desktop
        - Slack
        - Dropbox
        - Zoom
    - If these are not installed on your computer, or if there are other programs you need, e-mail Dan Holland and we can get ITS to install them on your computer. 
1. Complete all certifications and/or trainings required by Yale. To determine what trainings you need to complete, navigate [here](https://bmsweb.med.yale.edu/tms/tmspage).
    - You **need** to complete:
        - Human Subject Protection Training 
        - HIPAA Privacy and Security for Researchers 
        - Yale University HIPAA Security Attestation
1. Complete I9 verifications and related Workday HR administrative tasks that are required within your first week. 
1. Create various accounts that allow us to work collaboratively and remotely. For certain things, if you already have an account linked to your personal e-mail feel free to use that, or create another one using your Yale e-mail address.
